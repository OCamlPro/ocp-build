Depending on the current version of OCaml, the ./configure will set
the variable HAS_BYTES to one of the 3 available implementations of
stringCompat.ml.

$(HAS_BYTES)/stringCompat.ml will then be copied
into string-compat/ to be used by the Makefile to build the initial
(bootstrap) version of ocp-build.

Later, the version of stringCompat.ml in the current directory will
be used, using ocp-pp to decide what to export.
