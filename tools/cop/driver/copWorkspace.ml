   A workspace for COP is where all the projects to build are. It is
  usually specified by a file `cop-workspace` at the root of the workspace
  (changed using `--workspace WORKSPACE`).
  By default, COP will set its root at the largest surrounding workspace, unless
  `--local` is specified or `--root DIR` is specified).

  COP will then look for description files in the workspace directories:
  * `cop-project` files contain information on targets to build
  * `FILE.cop` files contain generic code (module files)
  * `cop-ignore` can be used to ignore specific sub-directories

  Modules files are interpreted once at the beginning. Then, COP will
  execute the workspace file (`cop-workspace`) and when asked for
  will execute all the `cop-project` files for each switch.
