(* This is the kind of things that we are supposed to support, as
ocamlfind does:

The variable "ppx" is a command that is added to the compiler
invocation via the -ppx option (available since OCaml-4.01). If the
command is relative to the current directory (e.g. ./cmd), the command
is expected in the package directory. The special forms as defined for
"archive" are also available (e.g. @otherpkg/cmd). Additional
arguments can be specified on the ocamlfind command line with the
-ppxopt option or the "ppxopt" variable.

The variable "ppxopt" is a set of options that are added to the ppx
rewriter invocation. The contents of the variable consists of one or
several whitespace-separated parts. Every part consists of several
comma-separated subparts; the first subpart indicates the package that
contains the ppx rewriter invocation, the rest contain the options to
be appended. If the option is a path relative to the current directory
(e.g. ./foo.cma), the path is expanded relative to the package
directory. The special forms as defined for "archive" are also
available (e.g. @otherpkg/foo.cma).

The following examples with ppx_driver: the ppx_driver tag is used to
discriminate between two cases:
* When using ppx_driver, the package should only add the library to
  the command line
* When not using ppx_driver, the package should trigger the call of './ppx'
  instead of using the library

# The following line must list the ppx dependencies of the rewriter

# that you are using inside the ppx rewriter. For instance if you are
# using the "str" library in the rewriter itself, put it here
requires(ppx_driver) = "str ..."
# The following line is for runtime dependencies, this allow users to
# just put ppx_foo as dependency and get both the rewriter and the

# The following line is optional, it is currently only used by
# toplevel_expect_test, which is a toplevel where the rewriting
# happens in the same process as the toplevel itself. This is useful
# for defining transformations and testing them immediately after
requires(ppx_driver,toploop) += "<runtime dependencies>"
# The next 5 lines are classic. The only difference with a normal
# library is that the archive is linked only if the "ppx_driver"
# predicate is present. This is to avoid linked them in the final
# executable itself

(* How -syntax works in ocamlfind ?

If [-syntax SYNTAX] is specified, then packages are interpreted
with the additional predicates "syntax" and SYNTAX. The additional
variable "preprocessor" is also computed (with the additional predicate
"preprocessor") to give an option "-pp" to ocaml.
